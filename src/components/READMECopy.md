## About this Website

This is my personal portfolio site. Its main purpose is to showcase my personal & professional work, but behind the scenes it's also one big practice project. 

I coded it from scratch as a way to exercise my web development skills, and because I like having the flexibility of a totally blank canvas to make it look & act however I want. It's been really fun figuring out various challenges and seeing it all come together! I'm hoping to do a lot more in the future.


### Planning & Design

I used Figma and Milanote to plan out what I wanted to do. The color scheme was inspired by a wallpaper that I really liked. Eventually I'll write more about the whole process here and include examples.

There's a lot left to do when it comes to building and improving this site, and I'm learning new things as I go. I'm a bit of a perfectionist so I'm constantly finding things to fix & improve. Check out my [To Do list](#to-do-list) to see what I'm up to.

#### React.JS?

React isn't necessarily recommended for simple websites like this, but I've been needing to put together a portfolio website for a very long time and I decided this would be a perfect chance to really play around with React.

I considered building it with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), which is a popular choice for static personal sites, but it requires GraphQL for API calls. My primary goal was to learn how to work with the Airtable API since that is where I have been storing & organizing all of my design projects, so I needed to start with something I'm more familiar with - [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch). 

Once I have a chance to learn GraphQL, I'll be able to rebuild this site with Gatsby. Or, I might look into some other similar options like Next.js or React Static.

### Credits

In this section, I'll try to keep track of where I get ideas & code snippets from. I obviously won't list every Stack Overflow answer and documentation site that I come across, but if I use a whole chunk of code, library, or other framework or take inspiration from a particular source, it will be credited here (...as long as I didn't lose it in my sea of 500 tabs).
