## About this Project

Hi there! This is my personal portfolio project.

Build stack:

- Scaffolding: [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- Navigation: [react-router-dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)
- Database: [Airtable](https://airtable.com/).
- Styling: [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)
- IDE: [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)
- Deployment: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

### Why React?

I know that React isn't necessarily recommended for simple websites like this, but I've been needing to put together a portfolio website for a very long time and I decided this would be a perfect chance to really play around with React.

In particular, I wanted to learn how to work with the Airtable API since that is where I have been storing & organizing all of my design projects. I had originally wanted to do this project in [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (which is meant for static stuff like portfolios), but I don't know anything about GraphQL yet and I _really_ wanted to have something quick. That meant using React since I'm already familiar with the basics and I could do the type of API calls I'm used to doing.

I also really really really love component-based development, because copy/pasting the same html a hundred times sucks.

### Up Next

- [x] Add react-router for linking between pages  
- [ ] write About page (what do I say about myself??)  
- [ ] figure out what exactly to put on the homepage  
- [x] add some links to the footer  
- [ ] create a form for the Contact page that submits data to Airtable  
- [ ] add a page to feature CodePen projects    
- [x] add markdown to the "description" Gallery field, and render with [react-markdown](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown)  
- [ ] optimize images so they load faster  
- [ ] do an accessibility pass to make sure I meet basic standards  

*bugs to fix*

- [ ] figure out what's wrong with my manifest.json file  
- [ ] figure out why GitHub is giving me a bunch of security warnings 

**big future plans**

- [ ] do a more in-depth accessibility analysis  
- [ ] add a blog module that uses markdown  
- [ ] add a blog subdomain to netlify  
- [ ] clean up & refactor my css a LOT  
- [ ] clean up & refactor some of my javascript and component organization

**even bigger future plans**

- [ ] learn GraphQL and redo the entire thing in Gatsby  
- [ ] migrate everything out of Glitch to my own local environment  
- [ ] convert this codebase to be used for [dexo.dev](https://dexo.dev/)  
- [ ] redo the layout so that I can have a sidebar component  
- [ ] look into SEO stuff

In this section, I'll try to keep track of where I get ideas & code snippets from. I obviously won't list every Stack Overflow answer and documentation site that I come across, but if I use a whole chunk of code, library, or other framework or take inspiration from a particular source, it will be credited here (...as long as I didn't lose it in my sea of 500 tabs).
