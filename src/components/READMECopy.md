### Credits

In this section, I'll try to keep track of where I get ideas & code snippets from. I obviously won't list every Stack Overflow answer and documentation site that I come across, but if I use a whole chunk of code, library, or other framework or take inspiration from a particular source, it will be credited here (...as long as I didn't lose it in my sea of 500 tabs).
