# About this Project

Hi there! This is my personal portfolio project. It's built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and renders data from [Airtable](https://airtable.com/). It's styled using Sass/scss via [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass).

## Why React?

I know that React isn't necessarily recommended for simple websites like this, but I've been needing to put together a portfolio website for a very long time and I decided this would be a perfect chance to really play around with React (and to practice some javascript in general).

In particular, I wanted to learn how to work with the Airtable API since that is where I have been storing all of the information for the various design projects I've done. I figured it would be cool to do this in a way where I could play around with the data in an environment that's meant for dynamically rendering components.

I also really really really love component-based development, because writing the same html a hundred times sucks.

## Future Plans

Eventually, I plan to redo the whole thing in [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) which is meant specifically for static stuff like portfolios and blogs. I had originally wanted to do this portfolio project in Gatsby from the beginning, but I don't know anything about GraphQL yet and I _really_ wanted to have something quick. That meant using React since I'm already familiar with the basics and I could do the type of API calls I'm used to doing. Soon I'll have time to start learning Gatsby & GraphQL... and I'll already have a working website while I do that!

My other reason for starting with React is that I do plan to convert this whole codebase to be used for a "playground" type of project website where I'll try out all sorts of cool dynamic stuff that React is actually meant for. Since everything is component based, it'll be easy to replace whatever I need to. The hard part will probably just be refactoring my css. It's a bit of a mess right now.

### Up Next

I'm trying to figure out React Router right now. Soon I'll have navigation and stuff!

# Credits

In this section, I'll try to keep track of where I get ideas & code snippets from. I obviously won't list every Stack Overflow answer and documentation site that I come across, but if I use a whole chunk of code, library, or other framework or take inspiration from a particular source, it will be credited here (...as long as I didn't lose it in my sea of 500 tabs).
